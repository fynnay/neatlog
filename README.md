Very simple but fancy look ing logging module.
It's based on python's standard logging module and uses the `colorlog` module written by Sam Clements (@borntyping on GitHub) for outputting colorized logs in the terminal and `colorama` by Jonathan Hartley (@tartley on GitHub) for Windows support.

- Want to quickly create informative and easy to read logs?
  - âœ… This is the right module for you.
- Want lots of customizability?
  - ðŸš« This is not the right module for you.
